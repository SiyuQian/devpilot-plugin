# Trello

Manage Trello boards and cards using direct REST API calls with credentials stored by the devpilot CLI.

## Setup

Run `devpilot login trello` to authenticate. This stores your API key and token at `~/.config/devpilot/credentials.json`.

If not logged in, tell the user to run `devpilot login trello` and stop.

## Reading Credentials

Extract credentials from the devpilot config:

```bash
TRELLO_KEY=$(cat ~/.config/devpilot/credentials.json | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['trello']['api_key'])")
TRELLO_TOKEN=$(cat ~/.config/devpilot/credentials.json | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['trello']['token'])")
```

Use these in all API calls as query parameters: `key=$TRELLO_KEY&token=$TRELLO_TOKEN`

## Name Resolution

Users refer to boards, lists, and cards by name. Always resolve names to IDs first:
- Boards: list all boards, match by name
- Lists: get board with `lists=open`, match by name
- Cards: search by keyword or get board with `cards=open`, match by name
