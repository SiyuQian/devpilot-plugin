# Pull Request / Merge Request Skill

**Core principle:** Read the actual diff before writing anything. Every sentence in the description
must come from code you read, not from branch names or assumptions.

**Operating mode: automatic by default.** Do not stop to confirm routine choices (branch name, commit message, draft body) — derive them from the diff and execute. Only stop for the destructive / ambiguous cases listed under [Hard Stops](#hard-stops). Showing a draft "for approval" before creating is **not** a hard stop; the user can `gh pr edit` after the fact.

## Quick Reference

| Action | GitHub | GitLab |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Create | `gh pr create --title "..." --body "..."` | `glab mr create --title "..." --description "..."` |
| Update | `gh pr edit <number> --title "..." --body "..."` | `glab mr update <number> --title "..." --description "..."` |
| Mark ready | `gh pr ready <number>` | `glab mr update <number> --draft=false` |
| Base branch | `--base <branch>` | `--target-branch <branch>` |
| Draft | `--draft` | `--draft` |
| Push | `git push -u origin HEAD` | `git push -u origin HEAD` |

## Worktree / autonomous invocation

Detect both up front — they change preflight rules.

```bash
git rev-parse --git-dir            # contains "/worktrees/" → you are in a linked worktree
git worktree list                  # confirms which worktree is which
```

**You are in autonomous mode** when this skill was invoked by a parent skill (e.g. `devpilot:resolve-issues`, `devpilot:auto-feature`) rather than directly by a human. In autonomous mode:
- The "stop and ask the user" gates below become "return control to the parent with the question" — never deadlock waiting for human input that isn't coming.
- Replace "show the draft to the user before creating" with "include the draft in your final response" so the parent skill can surface it.
- Do not `cd` out of the worktree; the parent owns cwd.

**Base branch.** Always diff and log against `origin/<default-branch>` (typically `origin/main`), not local `main`. In a worktree the local `main` ref may be stale or absent. Run `git fetch origin <default-branch>` before reading the diff so the comparison is honest.

## Preflight Checks

Before anything else, run these in parallel:

```bash
git remote get-url origin                    # detect platform (github.com → gh, gitlab.com → glab)
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD              # current branch
git rev-parse --git-dir                      # worktree detection (see above)
git fetch origin <default-branch> --quiet    # refresh base ref
git status                                   # working tree state
git log origin/<default-branch>..HEAD --oneline   # commits ahead of base
git diff --name-only origin/<default-branch>...HEAD  # files in the PR
git ls-remote --heads origin <branch>        # branch already on origin?
gh pr list --head <branch>                   # existing PR? (or glab mr list --source-branch)
```

### Auto-recover: on main/master

If `HEAD` is on `main`/`master`, **do not stop** — recover automatically:

1. Confirm none of the local commits ahead of base have been pushed to `origin/main`. If `git log origin/main..HEAD` is empty AND the working tree is clean, there is nothing to PR — exit. If commits ahead of base have **already been pushed to origin/main**, stop: the PR window has passed (see Hard Stops).
2. Pick a feature branch name (see [Branch naming](#branch-naming)).
3. `git checkout -b <name>` — this carries any uncommitted changes onto the new branch and leaves `main` untouched.
4. If there are uncommitted changes that belong in the PR, `git add` the relevant files (those whose paths overlap the intended PR scope) and commit with a conventional-commit message derived from the diff. Leave unrelated dirty files alone.
5. Continue with the normal flow.

**Never** run `git reset`, `git push --force`, `git push --force-with-lease`, or any history rewrite on `main`/`master` — not as a recovery, not as an "option," not ever.

### Auto-recover: dirty working tree overlapping the PR diff

If modified/staged files overlap the PR diff, **do not stop** — stage and commit them as part of the PR with a conventional-commit message derived from the changes. Files outside the PR diff stay untouched.

### Hard Stops

These are the *only* cases where you must stop. In autonomous mode, return the question to the parent instead of blocking:

- **Work already pushed to `origin/main`/`origin/master`.** The PR window for those commits has passed. Do not try to "rescue" it with history rewriting. Tell the user.
- **No commits ahead of base AND no uncommitted changes.** Nothing to PR.
- **Open PR already exists for this branch.** Switch to **update flow** (see below) — this isn't really a stop, just a branch in logic.
- **Remote branch diverged.** `git log HEAD..origin/<branch>` is non-empty after fetching. Reconcile by inspecting; never force-push.

**Do NOT block on:** untracked files, or modified files outside the PR diff. These are common in worktrees (test artifacts, scratch logs, leftovers from a parent agent) and are already excluded from `origin/<base>...HEAD`. Note them in your report and proceed.

### Branch naming

Derive deterministically — do not ask:

1. If there are commits ahead of base, parse the latest commit subject. Take its conventional prefix (`feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`) and slugify the rest: `<type>/<kebab-slug>` (max ~50 chars).
2. Otherwise (only uncommitted changes), pick the prefix from the change shape — `fix:` for bug language in modified code, `docs:` for `.md`-only, `chore:` for config/tooling, else `feat:`. Slug from the most-changed top-level directory or filename stem.
3. If a branch by that name already exists locally, append `-2`, `-3`, etc.

**Branch already on origin, but no open PR** (common after a draft-escalation push from `devpilot:resolve-issues`):
1. Only enter this branch if `git ls-remote --heads origin <branch>` returned a SHA. If it was empty, skip — `git push -u origin HEAD` will create the remote ref normally.
2. `git fetch origin <branch>` — see if remote has commits you don't.
3. If `git log HEAD..origin/<branch>` is non-empty, stop — the remote diverged. Reconcile by inspecting; never force-push.
4. Otherwise `git push -u origin HEAD` will fast-forward (or be a no-op). Then create the PR normally.

## Read the Diff (Required)

```bash
git diff origin/<default-branch>...HEAD   # full diff (always vs origin, not local)
git log origin/<default-branch>..HEAD --oneline
```

**You MUST read and understand the actual changes before writing the description.**

From the diff, determine:
- What files were added, modified, or deleted
- What the changes do functionally (bug fix? feature? refactor?)
- Whether there are test changes
- Whether there are breaking changes

**Red flags — you're writing a bad description if:**
- You're inferring what changed from the branch name instead of the diff
- You're using generic phrases like "implements skill definition and supporting logic"
- Your test plan mentions things not visible in the diff
- Your description would be the same for a completely different set of changes

## Find the Template

Check for existing project templates first:

**GitHub:** `.github/pull_request_template.md`, `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, `docs/pull_request_template.md`, `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, or files in `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/`

**GitLab:** `.gitlab/merge_request_templates/Default.md` or files in `.gitlab/merge_request_templates/`

If a project template exists, use it. Fill it in based on the diff. Remove irrelevant sections entirely.

If no project template exists, **read ONE template** based on what you found in the diff:

| Changes touch frontend? | Bug fix or feature? | Read this file |
|---|---|---|
| Yes | Feature | [templates/frontend-feature.md](templates/frontend-feature.md) |
| Yes | Bug fix | [templates/frontend-bugfix.md](templates/frontend-bugfix.md) |
| No | Feature | [templates/backend-feature.md](templates/backend-feature.md) |
| No | Bug fix | [templates/backend-bugfix.md](templates/backend-bugfix.md) |
| Both | Either | Read both relevant templates, combine sections |
| Docs/config only | — | Use just Description + Review Guide, no template needed |

**Only read the template you need.** Do not read all four.

## Write the Description

**Title:** Under 72 characters. Use conventional commit prefix (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `chore:`). Be specific — "fix: auth redirect loop in OAuth callback" not "fix: bug".

**Review Guide (required):** Every PR must include a Review Guide section:
- Which file to start reviewing first
- Suggested review order for large diffs
- Any tricky logic or non-obvious decisions to watch for

**Body guidelines:**
- Lead with what changed and why, based on the actual diff
- Reference specific files, functions, or behaviors you saw in the code
- Run the project's lint/test commands and report results in the checklist
- Leave "For Reviewers (human)" items unchecked — those are for humans
- For bug fixes, describe the bug, root cause, and fix separately

**Do not stop to "show the draft for approval."** Write the strongest title and body you can from the diff and create the PR directly. Report the URL afterward; the user can `gh pr edit <number>` if they want to tweak. In autonomous mode (invoked by a parent skill), include the final body inline in your response so the parent can surface it.

## Create and Report

Push the branch if needed, create the PR/MR, and share the URL.

```bash
git push -u origin HEAD                    # if not already pushed
gh pr create --title "..." --body "..."    # GitHub
glab mr create --title "..." --description "..."  # GitLab
```

## Update an Existing PR/MR

When preflight finds an open PR for the current branch, or the user explicitly asks to update:

**1. Read the current PR state:**
```bash
gh pr view <number>                # GitHub — see current title, body, status
glab mr view <number>              # GitLab
```

**2. Read the full diff** (same as creating — the description must reflect ALL commits, not just new ones).

**3. Decide: preserve or rewrite.**
- **New commits added** to an existing PR → rewrite the full description to cover all commits. Don't just append — re-read the complete diff and write a cohesive description.
- **Reviewer feedback** on description → address the specific feedback while keeping the rest.
- **Draft → Ready** → update description if it was a WIP placeholder, then mark ready.

**4. Execute the update directly** (do not stop for approval):
```bash
gh pr edit <number> --title "..." --body "..."    # GitHub
glab mr update <number> --title "..." --description "..."  # GitLab
```

**5. Mark ready (if transitioning from draft):**
```bash
gh pr ready <number>               # GitHub
glab mr update <number> --draft=false  # GitLab
```

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Description based on branch name, not diff | Read `git diff` first. Always. |
| Generic test plan ("verify no regressions") | Reference specific test files or manual steps from the diff |
| Auto-checking all checklist items | Run lint/test commands for verifiable items; leave human items unchecked |
| No Review Guide section | Always tell reviewers where to start and what to watch for |
| Generic bug fix description ("fix bug") | Describe the bug symptom, root cause, and fix separately |
| Leaving irrelevant sections as "N/A" | Remove the section entirely |
| Force-pushing main to create a retroactive branch | Never offer this as an option. If work is on main and pushed, the PR opportunity has passed |
| Creating duplicate PR for branch with existing PR | Check `gh pr list --head <branch>` first — update instead |
| Blocking on untracked/unstaged files unrelated to the PR | Only block when the dirty files appear in `origin/<base>...HEAD`. Untracked debris in a worktree is common and already excluded |
| Diffing against local `main` in a worktree | Local `main` may be stale or absent in a worktree — always use `origin/<default-branch>` |
| Force-pushing because the branch already exists on origin | Fetch first; if remote diverged, reconcile, never force. Fast-forward push is fine |
| Appending to PR description instead of rewriting | Re-read the full diff and write a cohesive description covering all commits |
| Stopping to ask "should I create a feature branch?" when on main | Don't. Auto-create per [Auto-recover: on main](#auto-recover-on-mainmaster). The only main-related stop is when the work was already pushed to `origin/main` |
| Stopping to "show the draft for approval" before creating | Don't. Create directly; user edits after via `gh pr edit` |
| Asking the user to pick a branch name | Derive it per [Branch naming](#branch-naming). Don't prompt |

## Red Flags — you are over-confirming

If you catch yourself about to write any of these, stop and just execute:

- "Want me to create a feature branch?"
- "Here's the draft — should I proceed?"
- "What should I name the branch?"
- "Should I commit these changes first?"

The only legitimate stops are listed under [Hard Stops](#hard-stops). Everything else is automatic.

## Tips

- For stacked PRs, mention the dependency chain.
- If the diff is large, highlight the most important files for reviewers.
- Respect the user's language — if they write in Chinese, write the PR in Chinese (unless the project convention is English).
