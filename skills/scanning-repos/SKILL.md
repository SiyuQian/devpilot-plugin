description: Use when the user asks to scan, audit, or sweep an entire GitHub repository for issues and file them as tickets — "scan this repo", "audit the codebase", "find bugs/security holes/missing tests", "check the docs are still accurate", "/repo-scan", "open issues for all the problems you find". Scans security, edge cases, testing coverage, and doc/code drift (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, README.md and the docs they link to) without assuming business logic. Do NOT use for reviewing a single PR (use devpilot:pr-review) or language-specific style review (use devpilot:google-go-style).

## Overview

A whole-repo sweep that dispatches **four parallel specialist sub-agents** (security, edge-case, coverage, doc-drift), scores every finding 0–100 for confidence, filters below threshold, then files each surviving finding as a labeled GitHub issue. Business logic is out of scope — scanners only catch mistakes a reasonable reader could flag without domain knowledge. The doc-drift scanner audits the entry-point docs (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`) and every doc file they link to, checking falsifiable claims against the current code.

**Core principle:** coverage during scan, filtering during scoring, noise-free issues at the end. The sub-agents are told to surface everything they notice; a separate scoring pass kills the noise so the human only sees load-bearing issues.

## When NOT to Use

- Single PR / diff review → `devpilot:pr-review`.
- Pure style / lint / formatting → the relevant style skill (`devpilot:google-go-style`, etc.) + the project's linter.
- Business-logic correctness ("does this function compute the right tax rate?") → a human with domain context.
- Repo without a `.github`-style issue tracker, or user doesn't want issues created → ask first; print findings to terminal instead.

## Workflow

1. **Resolve target.** Accept `owner/repo`, a clone URL, or "this repo" (use `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner`). Verify with `gh repo view`.
2. **Reconcile labels — rename non-canonical matches, reuse exact matches, create what's missing.** Do NOT blindly paste a `gh label create` block. The procedure:
   1. **Snapshot existing labels:** `gh label list --limit 200 --json name,description > /tmp/devpilot-existing-labels.json`. If the count returned equals the limit, raise `--limit` and re-run until the result is shorter than the limit.
   2. **For each label the skill needs** (the full taxonomy lives in `references/labels.md`): classify the closest existing repo label into one of three buckets:
      - **Exact match** — the repo label name already equals the canonical `type:value` (e.g. repo has `scan:security`). **Reuse as-is.**
      - **Semantic match, non-canonical name** — same intent, different name (e.g. repo has `security` or `type-security` for `scan:security`; `nil-deref` for `edge:nil-deref`). **Rename to the canonical name** with `gh label edit "<old-name>" --name "<canonical-name>" --description "<canonical-desc>"`. Renaming preserves all existing issue associations, so this is safe and brings the repo onto our taxonomy. Confirm the rename plan with the user before executing if more than 3 labels are being renamed at once.
      - **Too generic / wrong intent** — e.g. `bug` for `edge:nil-deref`, or `enhancement` for anything scan-related. **Do NOT rename and do NOT reuse.** Create the canonical label fresh; leave the generic label alone.
   3. **Build a name-mapping table** for this run: `canonical_name → label_to_apply`. After renames, every entry should be the canonical `type:value` name. The orchestrator uses this mapping when filing issues in step 7.
   4. **Create the labels that had no match.** Use the canonical `type:value` form. See `references/labels.md` for the exact `gh label create` invocation per label (colors and descriptions).
   5. **Print the reconciliation summary** to the user before continuing: `N reused, R renamed (old → new), M created` — so they can spot a wrong rename or reuse before issues get filed.

   `area:*` labels follow the same three-bucket rule but are reconciled lazily at filing time (step 7): for each finding, check the snapshot for an existing area-ish label covering the same top-level dir; rename it to `area:<dir>` if it's a semantic match with a non-canonical name, otherwise create.
2.4. **Build (or refresh) the codegraph — MANDATORY.** The security, edge-case, and coverage scanners all use `devpilot graph` queries (`callers_of`, `tests_for`, hubs) to verify findings before emitting them; without the graph their output is grep-only noise.

   ```bash
   devpilot graph build --repo .
   devpilot graph hubs --threshold 5 > /tmp/devpilot-graph-hubs.json
   ```

   - Build is incremental on re-runs (~1–2s on devpilot-sized repos, <30s on most monorepos).
   - The hubs snapshot is passed to every scanner so they can upgrade severity for high-fanin symbols.
   - **If `devpilot graph build` fails** (unsupported language, parser crash, no git): record the failure reason, print it to the user, and continue WITHOUT the graph. Every scanner is then told `graph: unavailable` — they will emit findings with that marker, and the scoring pass downgrades them aggressively (typically below the 75 threshold). Do NOT silently skip — the user must see that confidence is degraded.
   - **Never skip this step to "save time."** The whole skill is minutes long; the graph adds seconds and is the single biggest precision improvement.

2.5. **Build the file manifest AND the doc manifest.**
   - **Source manifest** (`/tmp/devpilot-scan-manifest.txt`): one walk, sampled path list of production source files for the security / edge-case / coverage scanners. They MUST NOT re-walk — they may only read paths in this manifest. See "Scaling for large repos" below. Default cap: **800 files** (`--full` raises to 2000, `--scope <dir>` constrains to a subtree).
   - **Doc manifest** (`/tmp/devpilot-doc-manifest.txt`): built independently for the doc-drift scanner. Steps:
     1. Find every entry-point file, case-insensitive, anywhere in the repo: `fd -HI -t f -i '^(claude|agents|readme)\.md$'` (fallback: `find . -type f -iregex '.*/\(claude\|agents\|readme\)\.md'`).
     2. Parse markdown links from each — both inline `[text](path)` and reference `[text]: path` forms — keep only relative targets that resolve to existing files with doc-ish extensions (`.md`, `.mdx`, `.txt`, `.rst`) or living under a `docs/`-style directory. Strip `#anchor` for resolution but keep it for the scanner's reporting.
     3. Recurse one hop at a time, dedupe by absolute path, cap at depth 3 and at 200 doc files total. Write the resulting list to `/tmp/devpilot-doc-manifest.txt`. Print to the user: total entry points found, total docs in the manifest, and a tree showing which entry point pulled in which linked doc.
3. **Dispatch scanners in parallel.** In ONE message, launch four sub-agents using the prompts in `agents/`. Pass each of the first three the manifest path AND `/tmp/devpilot-graph-hubs.json`; they will run `devpilot graph query …` as their reachability oracle.
   - `agents/security-scanner.md` — pass `/tmp/devpilot-scan-manifest.txt` + hubs file
   - `agents/edge-case-hunter.md` — pass `/tmp/devpilot-scan-manifest.txt` + hubs file
   - `agents/coverage-auditor.md` — pass `/tmp/devpilot-scan-manifest.txt` + hubs file
   - `agents/doc-consistency-auditor.md` — pass `/tmp/devpilot-doc-manifest.txt` (no graph needed; doc claims are textual)
   Each returns a list of `Finding` objects (see format below). Scanners are told to emit everything they notice — including low-severity — because filtering happens in step 4, not in the scanner.
3.5. **Validate scanner output.** Pipe each scanner's JSON array through `python3 scripts/check-findings.py`. The `--manifest` flag is mandatory and chooses the manifest the scanner was dispatched against:
   - security / edge-case / coverage → `--manifest /tmp/devpilot-scan-manifest.txt`
   - doc-drift → `--manifest /tmp/devpilot-doc-manifest.txt`
   The script rejects findings whose `file` is not on the relevant manifest, missing required fields, invalid `category`/`subcategory`/`severity`/`model` enums, and empty `evidence`. Fix (or ask the scanner to re-emit) before scoring.
4. **Score every finding, in batches.** Group findings by category and dispatch ONE scoring sub-agent per batch of up to **25 findings** (not one per finding — the per-finding fan-out doesn't scale past ~50). The scoring agent returns a JSON array of `{index, score, reason}` aligned with the input order. See `references/scoring.md` for the rubric and the batched prompt.
5. **Filter.** Drop every finding with score `< 75`. If zero survive, stop — report "no high-confidence issues found" to the user and do not create issues.
6. **Deduplicate against existing issues.** Before filing, query existing scan issues. Use a search that covers BOTH the new taxonomy and the legacy `repo-scan` label (so re-runs against repos scanned under the old label set still dedupe correctly):
   ```bash
   gh issue list --search 'label:scan:security,scan:edge-case,scan:coverage,scan:doc-drift,repo-scan in:title' \
     --state all --limit 1000 --json title,number,state
   ```
   Normalize titles by lower-casing, stripping the `[scan:<category>]` / `[repo-scan:<category>]` prefix, and collapsing whitespace before comparing. Skip findings whose normalized title matches an existing issue. If `--limit 1000` returns exactly 1000, paginate with `--search "... created:<<date-of-oldest>"` until empty.
7. **File issues.** One `gh issue create` per surviving finding, using the template in `references/issue-template.md`. Labels: always exactly six — apply the labels from the step-2 mapping table for `scan:<category>`, the matching subcategory, `severity:<level>`, `confidence:<score>`, `model:<tier>` (taken from the finding's `model` field), plus an `area:<top-level-dir>` resolved lazily here. For the area label: first check `/tmp/devpilot-existing-labels.json` for a suitable existing label (e.g. repo already has `area-cmd` or `cmd` covering the dir). If it's an exact match, reuse; if it's a semantic match with a non-canonical name, rename it to `area:<dir>` via `gh label edit`; otherwise run `gh label create area:<dir>`.
8. **Summarize.** Print a compact table to the user: `[category] [severity] title → #issue-number`.

## Finding format

Every scanner returns a JSON array of objects with exactly these fields:

```json
{
  "category": "security | edge-case | coverage | doc-drift",
  "subcategory": "sec:injection | sec:authn-authz | sec:secrets | sec:crypto | sec:path-traversal | sec:ssrf-csrf | sec:deserialization | sec:tls-misconfig | edge:nil-deref | edge:bounds-overflow | edge:error-swallowed | edge:concurrency | edge:resource-leak | edge:input-validation | cov:no-test-file | cov:error-paths | cov:integration-seam | cov:stale-test | doc:broken-link | doc:missing-file | doc:command-mismatch | doc:stale-claim | doc:cross-doc-conflict",
  "title": "<≤80 chars, imperative — e.g. 'Sanitize shell input in cmd/devpilot/run.go'>",
  "severity": "high | medium | low",
  "model": "haiku | sonnet | opus",
  "file": "<path relative to repo root>",
  "line_range": "L42-L58",
  "evidence": "<2–5 lines quoted from the file, with line numbers>",
  "why_it_matters": "<1–3 sentences, no business-logic claims>",
  "suggested_fix": "<1–3 sentences; null if scanner can't confidently propose one>"
}
```

`subcategory` must match `category` (`sec:*` for security, `edge:*` for edge-case, `cov:*` for coverage, `doc:*` for doc-drift). See `references/labels.md` for the fixed enum — scanners do NOT invent new subcategory values. If a finding doesn't fit any subcategory, the scanner picks the closest fit OR drops the finding.

`model` is the implementer-routing tier consumed by `devpilot:resolve-issues`: the scanner's estimate of how capable a model the **fix** needs (haiku = mechanical single-file change, sonnet = default code-fix-plus-tests, opus = multi-file or subtle concurrency/security/architecture reasoning). Judge fix cost, not severity; when unsure pick the higher tier. Full rubric in `references/labels.md`.

For doc-drift, the `file` field is the **doc** containing the wrong claim (e.g. `README.md`, `docs/cli-reference.md`), not the source file the claim is about. The source file (or its absence) goes in `evidence`.

`evidence` is mandatory. A finding without quotable code is speculation — drop it at the scanner level.

**Graph evidence is mandatory for reachability-class findings.** Every `sec:injection`, `sec:path-traversal`, `sec:ssrf-csrf`, `sec:tls-misconfig`, `sec:deserialization`, `edge:nil-deref`, `edge:bounds-overflow`, `edge:input-validation`, `cov:no-test-file`, and `cov:stale-test` finding MUST close its `evidence` block with a trailing `graph:` line. Allowed values:

- `graph: <pattern> <symbol> → <result summary>` — verified via codegraph (e.g. `graph: callers_of internal/auth/oauth.go::openBrowser → 2 callers, both pass literal AuthURL from package init`).
- `graph: hub (fanin=N)` — appended in addition to a query result, when the symbol is in `/tmp/devpilot-graph-hubs.json`. Severity is bumped one step.
- `graph: unavailable — reachability not verified` — emitted only when `devpilot graph` failed in step 2.4. Scoring downgrades these.

Scanners that emit reachability-class findings without a `graph:` line have their findings dropped by the validator (`scripts/check-findings.py`).

## Scoring rubric (summary — full rubric in `references/scoring.md`)

| Score | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | False positive / pre-existing / would be caught by CI | drop |
| 25 | Might be real; scanner couldn't verify | drop |
| 50 | Real but minor nit | drop |
| 75 | Real, meaningful, verified in code | **file** |
| 100 | Certain, load-bearing, reproducible | **file** |

Threshold is 75, matching the confidence bar of a senior reviewer who doesn't cry wolf.

## What scanners MUST NOT flag

(These are pre-filtered at the scanner level — do not let findings like this through.)

- Anything a linter, formatter, type-checker, or compiler catches.
- Business-logic correctness — "this discount calculation is wrong" requires domain context the scanner doesn't have.
- Style / naming / readability nits — defer to style skills.
- "Missing tests" for files that are pure types, generated code, or obviously trivial (constants, one-line accessors).
- Dependency CVEs — that's Dependabot's job.
- Pre-existing issues on lines the scanner can see were untouched in recent history (scanner should `git log` to check if desired).

See each agent prompt for category-specific false-positive classes.

## Quick reference

| I want to… | Do this |
|---|---|
| Scan current repo | `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner` → pass to step 1 |
| Scan a specific path only | Tell each scanner: "scope = `internal/auth/` only" |
| Preview without filing issues | Skip step 2 and 7; print the table |
| Re-scan and not duplicate issues | Step 6 handles this; don't delete existing `repo-scan` issues |
| Change threshold | Edit step 5 — keep the 0/25/50/75/100 scale, move only the cutoff |

## Acceptance criteria (the "test" this skill is written against)

A correct run of this skill produces:

1. Exactly four scanner sub-agent dispatches, in parallel (security, edge-case, coverage, doc-drift).
2. Every filed issue has exactly six labels: `scan:<category>`, a matching `sec:*`|`edge:*`|`cov:*`|`doc:*` subcategory, `severity:<level>`, `confidence:<score>` (75 or 100), `model:<tier>` (haiku, sonnet, or opus, from the finding's `model` field), and an auto-derived `area:<top-level-dir>` (for doc-drift findings, derived from the doc file's path — e.g. a finding in `README.md` → `area:root`, in `docs/cli-reference.md` → `area:docs`).
3. No issue is filed whose scoring-agent score is below 75.
4. No duplicate of an existing open scan issue (under either the new `scan:*` labels or the legacy `repo-scan` label).
5. No finding cites business-logic correctness as the sole reason.
6. Every filed issue body quotes ≥2 lines of actual code with a `<file>#L<start>-L<end>` link.
7. If zero findings survive scoring, no issues are filed and the user is told so explicitly.
8. The codegraph is built (or its failure is recorded and surfaced) BEFORE scanners are dispatched, and every reachability-class finding carries a trailing `graph:` line in its `evidence`.

If any of these is violated, the skill failed — stop and correct before continuing.

## Scaling for large repos

A real-world stress test on `kubernetes/kubernetes` (16,942 source files, ~268k tokens just for the path list) surfaced three failure modes the workflow MUST defend against. This section is the contract — it is not optional.

### Failure modes (measured, not theoretical)

1. **Path-list explosion.** The full file list of a large monorepo can consume more tokens than a sub-agent's entire window, *before* a single file is read. Each scanner re-walking the tree triplicates the cost.
2. **Hardcoded directory allowlist misses.** The naive fallback `cmd/, internal/, api/, handlers/, controllers/, auth/, crypto/, utils/` matched **3% of code** on kubernetes (which has none of `internal/`, `api/`, `handlers/`, `controllers/`, `auth/`, `crypto/`, `utils/` at the top level). Hardcoded allowlists cannot be the fallback.
3. **Sink-grep volume swamps verify.** `exec.Command` alone returns 252 hits, `math/rand` 214, `InsecureSkipVerify` 93 — totalling 647 hits across just 6 patterns. A scanner told to "read the surrounding function" for each will either skip verification (and emit raw greps) or stop after a tiny fraction.

### The manifest algorithm (step 2.5)

The orchestrator builds the manifest BEFORE dispatching scanners:

1. **Inventory.** Run `find . -type f \( -name '*.go' -o -name '*.py' -o -name '*.js' -o -name '*.ts' -o -name '*.rb' -o -name '*.java' -o -name '*.rs' \) -not -path './vendor/*' -not -path './node_modules/*' -not -path '*/gen/*' -not -path '*/.git/*' | wc -l`. Call this `N`.
2. **If `N` ≤ 800**, the manifest is the full list — no sampling needed.
3. **If `N` > 800**, sample down to 800 with this priority order (concatenate, dedupe, truncate at 800):
   1. **Hot-path churn.** Files changed in the last 90 days, ranked by commit count: `git log --since=90.days.ago --name-only --pretty=format: -- '*.go' '*.py' '*.js' '*.ts' '*.rb' '*.java' '*.rs' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | awk '$2 != "" {print $2}'`. Take the top 400.
   2. **Top-level high-signal dirs by file count.** Dynamically discover (do NOT use the hardcoded allowlist): `find . -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d -not -name '.*' -not -name 'vendor' -not -name 'node_modules' -not -name 'test' -not -name 'tests' -not -name 'docs' -not -name 'examples'`, count source files in each, take the top 4 dirs by count, sample evenly from them up to 300 files. This is the part that fixes the kubernetes-allowlist mismatch — a repo with `pkg/` and `staging/` at the top will have those picked, not ignored.
   3. **Security-sensitive name patterns** as a final fill: any path containing `auth`, `crypto`, `secret`, `cred`, `token`, `password`, `cert`, `tls`, `oauth`, `session`, `jwt`, `signin`, `login`. Take up to 100.
4. **Write `/tmp/devpilot-scan-manifest.txt`**, one path per line. Print to the user: total `N`, manifest size, and the top 5 dirs represented (so they can sanity-check that the sampling caught the right slice).
5. **`--full` mode** raises the cap to 2000 but still goes through the same priority sampling. Above 2000, refuse and ask the user to scope.
6. **`--scope <dir>` mode** skips churn ranking — manifest is `find <dir>` capped at 800.

### Sink-grep budget (per scanner)

Each scanner runs its dangerous-sink greps ONLY against files in the manifest, not the whole tree:

```bash
grep -nE 'exec\.Command|InsecureSkipVerify|...' $(cat /tmp/devpilot-scan-manifest.txt)
```

Cap per pattern: **40 hits**. If a pattern returns more, take the top 40 by file (prefer files that also appear in the churn list — recently-modified hits beat ancient ones). The remainder is logged as "skipped: N additional `<pattern>` hits not verified" in the scanner's output, so the user sees coverage gaps explicitly rather than silently.

### Scoring batching (step 4)

Group findings by category, send up to **25 findings per scoring sub-agent** dispatch in one message. For 200 findings across three categories that's ~9 scoring dispatches, not 200. The scoring agent's batched prompt lives in `references/scoring.md`.

### Dedupe pagination (step 6)

`gh issue list --limit 200` silently truncates — confirmed against kubernetes/kubernetes. Always use `--limit 1000`, check whether exactly 1000 returned, and paginate with `created:<<<date>` until the page is short. See step 6.

## Rationalizations to refuse

These are the excuses agents (and the orchestrator) reach for when under context or time pressure. Every one of them has been observed; refuse them by name.

| Excuse | Reality |
|---|---|
| "Graph build is slow — I'll skip step 2.4 this run." | Incremental builds take seconds. Skipping the graph cuts scanner precision in half — every reachability-class finding falls back to "low" and gets filtered out, so you ship fewer real issues, not more. |
| "`callers_of` returned empty, so the sink is unreachable — drop the finding." | Empty callers = either dead code OR the symbol is a registered entry point (HTTP handler, init() side effect, exported library API). Re-read the file before concluding unreachable. If genuinely dead, drop. If entry point, the symbol IS directly reachable from external input — confirmed finding. |
| "`tests_for` returned empty but I see a `*_test.go` in the same directory — surely it covers this." | Trust the graph. The graph reads call edges, not filenames. If `tests_for` is empty, the same-dir test file isn't actually calling the symbol. File the finding. |
| "Grep already found the sink, that's enough." | Grep finds patterns, not paths. A sink with no reachable untrusted caller is noise. Without the `graph:` line the finding is rejected by `check-findings.py`. |
| "Graph build failed — I'll just run the scanners anyway and not mention it." | The user must see degraded confidence. Step 2.4 prints the failure; scanners must tag every finding with `graph: unavailable`; scoring downgrades them. Silent fallback hides quality loss. |
| "Re-running `callers_of` for every finding is too many tool calls." | Each query is sub-millisecond against the cached graph. The whole verification budget per scanner is dozens of calls, not thousands. |
| "Hubs file isn't important — severity defaults are fine." | A nil-deref in a fan-in-15 helper is a different incident than one in a single-caller utility. The hub bump is the cheapest precision lever in this skill. |

## Common mistakes

- **Letting scanners filter their own output.** They should over-report. The scoring pass does the filtering. Merging the two loses calibration.
- **Using the scanner agent to also create the issue.** Don't — the scanner has too much context. File issues from the main agent after scoring.
- **Dropping the evidence block in the issue body.** Without it the human has to re-derive the finding. File a crap issue once and nobody trusts the skill.
- **Mass-creating the full taxonomy upfront without checking the repo.** The skill MUST snapshot existing labels (step 2) and reconcile against them. Blindly creating `scan:security` when the repo already has `security` doubles the label space and fragments triage queries — rename `security` to `scan:security` instead.
- **Reusing a non-canonical name as-is instead of renaming it.** If the repo has `security` and we file under `scan:security`, both labels now exist with overlapping intent. Rename the existing one to bring the repo onto the canonical taxonomy.
- **Renaming a too-generic label.** Don't rename `bug` to `edge:nil-deref` — it's attached to unrelated existing issues. Generic labels stay; create the canonical one alongside.
- **Creating subcategory or severity labels inside the issue-creation loop.** Reconcile in step 2, file in step 7. Only `area:*` is resolved lazily, and even then it goes through the same suitable-existing-label check.
- **Asking scanners to rank severity *and* confidence.** Confidence is the scoring pass's job; scanners assign severity and the `model` tier only.
- **Forgetting the dedupe step.** Re-running the skill must be idempotent or the user will stop running it.

## Evaluation

Test scenarios for this skill live in `evals/evals.json`. Each eval gives a prompt, expected output shape, and machine-checkable assertions (e.g. *`exactly_three_scanner_dispatches`*, *`no_business_logic_findings_filed`*, *`all_issues_have_six_labels`*). Run before shipping any change to scanner prompts or the scoring rubric.
