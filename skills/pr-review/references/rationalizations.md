# Rationalizations and Self-Check

Common shortcuts the reviewer may reach for, and what to do instead. The "Reality" column is the rule.

## Table

| Excuse | Reality |
|---|---|
| "This PR is small, skip the five questions." | Small PRs change defaults, delete branches, flip flags. Answer all five; "N/A" is fine. |
| "The author explained intent in the description." | Intent ≠ actual behavior. Trace one input through the code. |
| "Diff looks clean, no need to look at callers." | Diff shows what changed, not the blast radius. Check Unknown-Unknowns Sweep question 2. |
| "I recognize the pattern, I can assert the right way." | Training can be 6–18 months stale. Do question 4 first. |
| "Writing a retry loop / cache / parser here is fine." | Usually there is a mature off-the-shelf option. Do question 5. |
| "LGTM, nothing jumps out." | Trace at least one input through at least one change first. |
| "This feels minor, I'll leave it out to keep the review tidy." | Report it with Confidence + Severity labels. Filtering happens downstream, not here. |
| "I'm unsure, I'll file it as Should-fix to be safe." | Severity is impact-if-true; Confidence is how sure you are. Keep them separate. |
| "I'll just print the review in chat, user can paste it." | Post by default. Only skip when the user opts out or no real PR exists. |
| "Blocking finding, but I'll post as `COMMENT` to be polite." | Event follows severity: a Blocking finding goes with `REQUEST_CHANGES`. |
| "I'll list all findings in the body — easier to read than scrolling inline." | Findings tied to a line go inline so the author can act on each one in place. The body is for TL;DR, sweep summary, counts, and overall observations only. |
| "No clean line for this one, so I'll put it in the body." | Anchor to the most representative line and say so in the comment. The author can ask for a different anchor; they cannot resolve a body bullet. |
| "This is a code-quality nit, not behavior — skip it." | The skill runs both passes: behavior sweep *and* the quality checklist. Code quality, architecture, testing, requirements, production-readiness are in scope. |
| "Behavior trace is the whole point — checklist items are filler." | Behavior sweep is what makes the review more than style; the checklist is what makes it more than a behavior trace. Run both. |
| "I'll post the inline comments as standalone PR comments via `gh pr comment`." | Standalone comments aren't part of the review and don't show up in the right pane. Use one combined `POST .../pulls/:num/reviews` with body + `comments[]` + event. |
| "I'll split blockers and nits into two reviews." | One review per pass. The author gets one notification, one set of comments, one verdict. |
| "I'll skip the eligibility gate and just review." | The gate is 1–2 `gh` calls. Skipping it wastes a fanout on a dependabot PR or duplicates a review you already posted. |
| "I'll run the five passes myself instead of dispatching subagents." | The fanout is parallel for a reason — five agents in one turn finish in the time of one, and the main session keeps its context for filtering and drafting. Sequential single-thread defeats the design. |
| "I'll skip one of the five agents — Agent D/E rarely finds anything." | The angles are independent. Skipping an angle by hunch is how silent defects survive. Run all five; the filter step is where you discard noise. |
| "Confidence 65, but the bug feels real — I'll round up to 75." | Don't bargain with yourself. Open the file that would raise confidence to 85, or drop it. The rubric exists so 70 means something. |
| "All findings are < 70 — I'll lower the threshold to surface something." | A clean fanout is allowed to produce zero findings. Approve and move on. Lowering the threshold to fill space is noise. |
| "Same defect on 4 lines — I'll post 4 nearly-identical comments." | One consolidated inline comment anchored to the worst occurrence, with the other `path:line`s listed inside. Recurrence count goes in the body sweep summary. Four near-identical comments is the noise inline-first is meant to avoid. |
| "I'll put the body link in short-SHA form, the reader can figure it out." | GitHub Markdown previews require the full 40-char SHA. Short SHA or branch name → no rendered preview. Use `git rev-parse HEAD`. |
| "I'll skip the Verdict — readers can infer it from the counts." | The Verdict is the one thing every reader looks at. State it explicitly: Yes / With fixes / No. |
| "I'll skip Strengths — sounds performative." | Accurate praise gates trust in the rest of the review. Two specific bullets, not generic compliments. |
| "I'll ask 'what happens when X?' so the author clarifies." | If the code can answer it, state the answer. Author questions live in Open Questions only. |
| "I have a better approach but I'll stay neutral." | Name it, one sentence on why, ask the author to confirm. |
| "Graph says this symbol has 0 callers — must be dead code, skip it." | `callers.count: 0` means *no static caller in the indexed languages*. Reflection, codegen, RPC, CLI dispatch tables, and test main files are invisible to the graph. Confirm with one grep before claiming dead code. |
| "Graph says change_type=modified, so the symbol's behavior changed." | `change_type` is line-overlap based; neighboring edits can mark a struct/function "modified" without changing its shape. Diff the symbol body before treating it as a behavior change. |
| "Graph is unavailable, so I'll skip the blast-radius question." | Fall back to grep and note `grep-only fallback` in the sweep summary. The question still has to be answered; only the source of the answer changes. |
| "Graph corroborated my finding, so I'll skip reading the caller file." | Graph confirms the edge exists; it does not confirm the caller still satisfies the new contract. Open the caller. |

## Self-check before posting

Before running `gh pr review`, run through this list. A "yes" on any item means the review is not ready; fix the underlying issue and re-check.

- Eligibility gate skipped — PR turned out to be draft / merged / dependabot / already reviewed.
- Fanout collapsed: only 1–2 of the five agents ran, or all five ran sequentially in the main session.
- Findings with `confidence < 70` made it into the review.
- Verdict (`Ready to merge: ...`) missing from the body.
- Strengths section missing or replaced by generic compliments.
- Writing findings before the five blind-spot questions were answered.
- Findings are all naming / formatting / "could be cleaner".
- Comparing two options the author already listed instead of surfacing ones they did not consider.
- "LGTM" without a single traced input.
- Only files in the diff were opened; no callers, tests, or configs.
- Findings tied to a line dumped into the body instead of attached as inline comments.
- An inline comment that repeats the file path or line number inside its text.
- A cross-cutting finding promoted to the body because "no line fit" — should have anchored to the most representative line.
- Author questions about behavior the code could have answered.
- Known-better alternatives hidden as vague questions.
- Findings missing a `Confidence` line.
- Review event does not match the highest-severity finding.
- Inline comments and body posted as separate API calls instead of one combined POST.
- Review is not in the PR's language end-to-end (including the disclaimer and inline-comment field labels).
